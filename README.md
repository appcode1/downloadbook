# downloadbook
In order to read the Chinese book offline at my kindle device, I'd like to download the book to my local computer from 99csw.com where many books can be read online.

In order to run this javascript code, need to prepare the environment:
1. install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/
2. download this javascript file to the local machine, save to some folder
3. from the Command line, go to the above folder
4. install puppeteer: npm i puppeteer
5. run this javascript file to download the book: node downloadbook.js

If you want to download a different book, just use any editor to open this javascript file and edit the it.

Have fun!

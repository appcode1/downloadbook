# downloadbook
In order to read the Chinese book offline at my kindle device, I'd like to download the book to my local computer from 99csw.com, and then copy the book to the Kindle device.

In order to run this javascript code, need to prepare the environment:
1. install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/
2. download this javascript file to the local machine, save to some folder
3. from the Command line, go to the above folder
4. install puppeteer: npm i puppeteer

If you want to download a different book, just use any editor to open this javascript file and edit it.

In the command line, just run this javascript file to download the book:
  node downloadbook.js


Have fun!
